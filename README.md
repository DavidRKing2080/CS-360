Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

//Gravitas is a simple weight-tracking application that allows a user to build, edit, and view a table alongside setting a goal weight to pursue. It has a minimalistic design to enable ease-of-use and possible additional features. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

//Gravitas operates through a total of three simple screens for logging in, registering, or using the application. All necessary information is presented on the home screen, including the goal weight display and a table of daily weights editable per entry.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

//Having no experience with android studio prior to this course, development was something of a learning curve. There was a lot of research, experimentation, implementation, and refinement involved in developing an app and avoiding code bloat. A lot of useful information was gleaned from the experience, especially regarding debugging and setting up databases. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

//I meticulously went through as many manual tests as I could. Though if the app were larger I'd have invested time in implementing some form of automated static testing as well. Any time a feature was added, I would iterate through every possible outcome, including trying my best to break the application.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

//I began my application on shakey ground having misunderstood a few things about android studio. This required a lot of overhauling and documentation reading to modernize my code and avoid the pitfalls of technical debt.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

//I'm most proud of the table editor! Instead of crowding the home screen with buttons, all editing requires is tapping an entry and opening up a zoomed in screen to edit or delete that entry.
